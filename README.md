A basic tetris, written with AWS and Swing. Grew from a single self-operating class to a multi-class monster, employing MVC-pattern views, managers and models, it also makes use of listeners, adapters, animations, (slight) physics and abstract game-object classes.
Versus the single-class solution, this projects gets updated with a woefully made game-loop that handles a list of gameobjects added to its queue that updates logic without being tied to FPS.
